## Garage menagment app
* A basic garage management system that handles 3 types of vehicles with the option of a fuel/electric engine.
* Advanced use of reflexchain in order to allow an option for better maintenance. As a result, it is possible to add more vehicles in the future without making any changes to the existing code, with the exception of the factory department.
* An option to reuse the code, thanks to the separation between the user interface and the logic, therefore in the future it is possible to build a web user interface, a mobile application and more.
* Object-oriented coding that includes principles of inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation and more.
* Solving the multiple inheritance problem by a bridge template, for example a car that is both a vehicle and electric/fuel creates an engineering problem that the template solves.
* Using a factory template in a separate class to create the objects.
